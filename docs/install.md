# Installing *buzz*

*buzz* requires Python 3.6 or higher. You can install it easily with *pip* (ideally, from inside a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install buzz
```

To also include the frontend, *buzzword*, you can use:

```bash
pip install buzz[word]
```

## Installing from the repository

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/interrogator/buzz
```

Once installed, you'll either want to [work within a Python session](corpus.md), or, if you installed *buzzword*, [set up and run the graphical interface](https://buzzword.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
