`buzz` is a library for parsing and analysing natural language.

It relies heavily on *pandas*, *numpy*, *spaCy*, and occasionally *NLTK*. Constituency parsing can be performed with either *benepar* or *bllip*. Dependency searching is handled by a purpose-built library called *depgrep*.

A general introduction to the basics of *buzz* is available [via GitHub](https://github.com/interrogator/buzz). This site provides more comprehensive
