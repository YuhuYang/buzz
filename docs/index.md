`buzz` is a library for parsing and analysing natural language.

It relies heavily on *pandas*, *numpy*, and occasionally *NLTK*. Constituency parsing can be performed with either *benepar* or *bllip*. Dependency parsing is done by *spaCy*, and dependency searching is handled by a purpose-built library called [*depgrep*](https://github.com/interrogator/depgrep).

A general introduction to *buzz* is available [via GitHub](https://github.com/interrogator/buzz). This site provides more comprehensive documentation.

For the web-app based on *buzz*, called *buzzword*, head [here](https://buzzword.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
